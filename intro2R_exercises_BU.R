# Make a directory on your computer (BONUS: do this at the command line)
# Set your working directory to that directory


# PART 1: Analyzing Donut Consumption ----

# Create a vector of 20 random numbers ranging from 1 to 10. Call it `donuts_week1`.


# Create a vector of 20 random numbers ranging from 5 to 15. Call it `donuts_week2`.

# Summarize the `donuts_week1` and `donuts_week2` objects using the `summary` function


# What is the data type of the `donuts_week2` and `donuts_week1` objects?


# Make a histogram of `donuts_week1`. Title the histogram "Donut Consumption at Peer Coding Hour". Call the x-axis "Number of Donuts Eaten by Peer Coders".

# Plot a histogram of `donuts_week2` on top of a histogram of `donuts_week1`.
# HINT: you may want to play around with colors here. You'll definitely need to adjust the axes to see all of the data.
# BONUS: add a legend to the figure to discrimate between the histograms


# Use a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the number of donuts consumed on week 1 vs. week 2


# PART 2: Relationship between Donut and Coffee Consumption ----
# Create a vector of 20 random numbers ranging from 1 to 10. Call it `coffee_week1`.



# Examine this data in some way. Coders choice!


# Create a data frame called `coffee_donut_data` that has one column for `donuts_week1` and one column for `coffee_week1`


# Enter a line of code that tells you what type of object `coffee_donut_data` is and what type of data it contains (integers? characters?)


# Plot donuts consumed on the x-axis and coffee consumed on the y-axis. Give the plot a name. Label the x- and y-axes.



# Use a linear model to test the relationship between coffee and donut consumption. Save the results to a variable called `lm_coffee_donuts`.


# Summarize `lm_coffee_donuts`


# Add a regression line to the plot you made earlier using this linear model.
